It is continuation of my work to learn graphics programming and make game on my own Game Engine with Software renderer. This and old projects are for learning purpose and to create my dream game on my own Game Engine with my own Software Renderer. So first version will be with naive and not efficient implementation but very informative to how rendering on basic level works.
I will implement math needed like vectors and matrices and other mathematics stuff and data structure. I will be learning from few old books but the most important are: both from same author Andre LaMothe

and
