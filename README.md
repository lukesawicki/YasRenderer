It is continuation of my work to learn graphics programming and make game on my own Game Engine with Software renderer. This and old projects are for learning purpose and to create my dream game on my own Game Engine with my own Software Renderer. So first version will be with naive and not efficient implementation but very informative to how rendering on basic level works. First implementation will be with use of Java language using simple Java Swing only for make window and draw pixelx. The rest will be obviously programmed by me(Vector and Matrixes and math for that and all basic of graphics).

My previous attempt are:
